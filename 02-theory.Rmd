## Social Comparison

Opower used social comparison to reduce energy use around the worlds. It's not about scientific facts, or research. It's about your position relative to others (i.e., whether you are better or worse at conserving energy compared to your neigbors) [@Cuddy_2010]


## Distraction Conflict Theory


## optimal Distinctiveness Theory 


## Signaling Theory 
People diverge to signal identity, which based on:  

 * Observability  
 * Functional benefits
 
"The more costly something is, the more likely it is to retain its value as a clear and accurate signal." [@Berger_2016]
Costs in this case could be:  

 * Monetary 
 * Opportunity 
 * Time 
 
Price and branding has an inverted-U relationship
The higher the price is, the more brand prominence it possess. 
However, for the ultra rich class, the highest price does not command highest brand prominence, but actually lowest brand prominence. (a small set of ultra rich people know)


"The identity-signaling drives things to both catch on and die out... Counterfeiting helps speed up the process "


We know that the mere exposure can increase our preference towards an object. Interestingly, the similarity between a new object and one that we are familiarity with also have the same effect. Novel but don't be too novel.
