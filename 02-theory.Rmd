# Theory

This is a list of theories that typically used in social science.

## Hofstede's cultural dimensions theory


## Social Comparison

Opower used social comparison to reduce energy use around the worlds. It's not about scientific facts, or research. It's about your position relative to others (i.e., whether you are better or worse at conserving energy compared to your neighbors) [@Cuddy_2010]

## Power Distance Theory



## Distraction Conflict Theory


## Optimal Distinctiveness Theory 


## Social Exchange Theory



## Resource based Theory

## Network Exchange Theory 
Cook and Whitmeyer 1992
Markovsky, Willer, Patton 1998 


## Signaling Theory 
People diverge to signal identity, which based on:  

 * Observability  
 * Functional benefits
 
"The more costly something is, the more likely it is to retain its value as a clear and accurate signal." [@Berger_2016]
Costs in this case could be:  

 * Monetary 
 * Opportunity 
 * Time 
 
Price and branding has an inverted-U relationship
The higher the price is, the more brand prominence it possess. 
However, for the ultra rich class, the highest price does not command highest brand prominence, but actually lowest brand prominence. (a small set of ultra rich people know)


"The identity-signaling drives things to both catch on and die out... Counterfeiting helps speed up the process "


We know that the mere exposure can increase our preference towards an object. Interestingly, the similarity between a new object and one that we are familiarity with also have the same effect. Novel but don't be too novel. 




## Goal Gradient Hypothesis

How close you are to achieve a bonus with your loyalty card, the more motivated you are. Compared to beginner coffee buyers, customers who almost complete a card buy more coffee (come back to the store sooner) [@Kivetz_2006]

Similar effects are also found in animals, rats are more motivated when they are closer to their goals [@Brown_1948;@Hull_1932;@Hull_1934]


However, too far behind couples with direct competition could not only lead people a little behind more motivated, but people far behind more demotivated. [@Fershtman_2011]

Interestingly, the mechanism for favored candidate to lose motivation is different from underdogs. To save face, favored candidate stops trying to have reason to excuse that if they were to keep trying, they would have won [@Dai_2018]


## Adatption Theory of Well-being
[@Diener_2006] People tend to return to their previous level of happiness after traumatic events. we tend to stay in a long-term disposition. 

[@Lyubomirsky_2005] long-term happiness depends 50% on a person's genetic set point, 10% on circumstances (whether you, how rich, how healthy they are), and 40% on what they choose to think and do. Hence, even if our friends are happy, they happiness will wear off, and return us the original level.
