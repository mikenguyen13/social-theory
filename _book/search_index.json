This was an overwhelming task for me as a Ph.D. student since there was an enormous amount of theories out there and people seem to just know and talk about them like their second language. Professors told me that through time I will read up and acquire more and more theories (or at least the relevant ones). However, my systematic mind cannot tolerate a disorganized way of learning or acquiring knowledge piece-meal like this. Hence, I read up on some handbooks and cheat-sheet regarding social theories. And, I compile these theories for my future research. If you read my first book on data analysis [https://bookdown.org/mike/data_analysis/], you will know how forgetful I can be. So again, I have to write down another book in a systematic way that I can quickly skim back in the future for relevant theories for my research. And please keep in mind that, by no means, this guide is a comprehensive one. Hence, if you think I should change anything, feel free to click on edit to modify that section. Recommendations on how to consume this book: If you know what you are looking for and just want to quickly brush up on a theory. You can just go to that theory section title. If you want an overview of all relevant theories, you can follow this book from the beginning till the end (my goal is write the most succinct version of every theory as possible).

(Chan, Berger, and Boven 2012) find that consumers can have both mechanisms satisfied when making a purchase decisions People conform under the informational or normative influence (Deutsch and Gerard 1955). People also make choices and decision similar to their aspiration groups to signal their desired identities (Berger and Heath 2007; Englis and Solomon 1995). People also have intricate needs for uniqueness (Lynn and Snyder 2002), since people sometimes experience an emotional reaction when being too similar. Unique motives can be driven by situational factors. consumers simultaneously pursue assimilation and differentiation goals on different dimensions of a single choice: they assimilate to their group on one dimension (by conforming on identity signaling attributes such as brand) while differentiating on another dimension(distinguishing themselves on uniqueness attributes such as color). Desires to communicate social identity lead consumers to conform on choice dimensions that are strongly associated with their group, particularly in identity-relevant consumer categories such as clothing. Higher needs for uniqueness lead consumers to differentiate within groups by choosing less popular options among those that are associated with their group (Chan, Berger, and Boven 2012) From the optimal distinctiveness theory, people seek to satisfy both the need fo assimilation nd differentiation (Brewer, 1991) consumption gains symbolic meaning as a marker of group membership (Chan, Berger, and Boven 2012) The consumer can simultaneously assimilate (i.e., by conforming to reference groups by choosing attribute that signals group identity such as brand) while differentiating from other in-group members on other choice dimensions such as color to achieve optimally distinct self-concept (Chan, Berger, and Boven 2012). People diverge from members of other social groups (dissimilar outgroups): when other social groups adopt tastes, people might abandon their current tastes to avoid signaling undesired identities, and costs of misidentification (Berger and Heath 2007) References "],["social-exchange-theory.html", "3.6 Social Exchange Theory", " 3.6 Social Exchange Theory "],["resource-dependence-theory.html", "3.7 Resource Dependence Theory", " 3.7 Resource Dependence Theory External resources (or the procurement of external resources) of organizations can influence the organizations behavior (Stern, Pfeffer, and Salancik 1979) The basic premise is as follows: Organizations depend on resources, which depends on its environment, where other organizations play a big part to operate (ecology). And resources are power, and one organizations need others to survive. Hence, power and resource dependence are interlocked. Since an organizations power (A) over another (B) is the same thing as organization Bs dependence on organization A. We can see that power is relational and situaitonal.

Hence, firms are skilled at certain activities due to their unique resources. Resource immobility assumption Differences in resources can be sustained due to the difficulty in trading resources. Based on these two assumption, RBT argues that since other firms find these valuable resources too costly or too difficult to imitate, then firms having these resources can have sustainable competitive advantage (Barney and Hesterly 2012) References "],["assumptions-and-logic.html", "3.9 Assumptions and logic", " 3.9 Assumptions and logic "],["network-exchange-theory.html", "3.10 Network Exchange Theory", " 3.10 Network Exchange Theory Cook and Whitmeyer 1992 Markovsky, Willer, Patton 1998 "],["signaling-theory.html", "3.11 Signaling Theory", " 3.11 Signaling Theory When do we diverge?

(Berger 2016) Costs in this case could be: Monetary Opportunity Time Price and branding (brand prominence) has an inverted-U relationship The higher the price is, the more brand prominence it possess. However, for the ultra rich class, the highest price does not command highest brand prominence, but actually lowest brand prominence. (a small set of ultra rich people know) The identity-signaling drives things to both catch on and die out Counterfeiting helps speed up the process Counterfeit and piracy are good because it keeps consumers crave for a new one (Berger 2016) We know that the mere exposure can increase our preference towards an object. Interestingly, the similarity between a new object and one that we are familiarity with also have the same effect. Novel but dont be too novel.

(Lyubomirsky, Sheldon, and Schkade 2005) long-term happiness depends 50% on a persons genetic set point, 10% on circumstances (whether you, how rich, how healthy they are), and 40% on what they choose to think and do. Hence, even if our friends are happy, they happiness will wear off, and return us the original level.

Promotion focus people tend to focus on growth, aspirations, achievement, while presentation focus people have an orientation towards safety or vigilance (Lee and Aaker 2004). Hence, advertisers (promotion-focused or prevention-focused) can create messages depend on their audience (Aaker and Lee 2001). Regulatory focus can depend on culture (western is more promotion focus as compared to eastern more prevention focus (Lee, Aaker, and Gardner 2000)), products (home-security or massage chairs), environment (e.g., 2000 bubble bursts induce investors to be more prevention-focused).

Interestingly, females exhibit this effect to a lesser extent. The name Coolidge comes from a joke about President Calvin Coolidge. The story is as follow:  The President and Mrs. Coolidge were being shown (separately) around an experimental government farm. When [Mrs. Coolidge] came to the chicken yard she noticed that a rooster was mating very frequently. She asked the attendant how often that happened and was told,Dozens of times each day.\" Mrs. Coolidge said, Tell that to the President when he comes by. Upon being told, the President asked, Same hen every time? The reply was, Oh, no, Mr. President, a different hen every time. President: Tell that to Mrs. Coolidge. (Johnson 1972) References "],["social-facilitation-inhibition.html", "4.2 Social Facilitation / Inhibition", " 4.2 Social Facilitation / Inhibition This phenomenon happens when the mere presence of others can alter ones performance. When the presence of others improve ones performance, we term it social facilitation. When the presence of others impair ones performance, we term it social inhibition. The phenomenon was first documented by (Triplett 1898). And later (Allport 1920) labeled it as social facilitation The moderator that decides whether the process is social facilitation or social inhibition is task familiarity/ complexity. The more familiar one is with a task, social facilitation will occur. The more difficult or novel a task is, the more likely that social inhibition will occur. According to (Zajonc and Sales 1966), an audience impairs the acquisition of new responses and facilitates the emission of well-learned responses (dominant responses). Hence, when facing a difficult task in combination with the presence of others will result in high arousal which results in stress and poor performance. The mechanism can be specified by the Distraction Conflict Theory, which states that the conflict between giving attention to spectators and to a task affects performance. Better performers resolve this conflict and direct more attention to the task. Another mechanism claim that its not the presence of others that affects performance, but the knowledge of others evaluation affect performance. Performers are aroused by audiences because they know that the are being evaluated. Hence, technically, passive spectators are not that passive. (Cottrell et al. 1968). This attempt to appear better in others eyes is also known as impression management, which has been studied extensively in management. Social Presence Task Consequence Presence of others Automatic, natural, well-learned Social Facilitation Difficult requires more attention Social Inhibition There are two stream of research which are Audience Effect Coaction Effect 4.2.1 Audience Effect Passive spectators affects performance Notable articles are: increased multiplication performance (Travis 1925) decreased memorizing a list of nonsense words (Pessin 1933) 4.2.2 Coaction Effect Active participants (same activity separately)affect performance The effect was also documented in animals such as ants will dig three times more with the presence of other ants (Chen 1937) animals will eat more with the presence of other of their species (Platt, Yaksh, and Darby 1967) References "],["snob-effect.html", "4.3 Snob Effect", " 4.3 Snob Effect This is effect is from micro-economics in which people demand for goods or services is negatively correlated with the market demand. (Leibenstein 1950) In the market of unique, expensive, or unusual products, price can be seen as quality itself. These items typically have high economic value (status) but low practical value. The availability of a product is negatively correlated with it snob value. Examples are arts, designer clothes. Snob effects are when an individuals demand for goods or services is negatively correlated with market demand. One might avoid buying things or doing things when too many are doing them (like a badge of distinction). To combat this, we can employ an illusion of distinction. Hence we focus on ways things are different, even if at the core they are very much the same. References "],["warm-glow-heuristic.html", "4.4 Warm Glow Heuristic", " 4.4 Warm Glow Heuristic The positive valence of a stimulus increases its perceived familiarity, even in the absence of prior exposure. (Monin 2003) Familiarity leads to liking because the ease of retrieving information in our brain. This mechanism also has evolutionary benefits, which helps familiarity stay together (spouses, children, parents). We know that familiarity leads to liking (preference), but the the other way around also works. Working-class people prefer similarity, and high-end people prefer uniqueness (Berger 2016) Similarity increases evaluation (and sales) for the same reason that mere exposure works. It is easy for our brain to process information (associative network) (Berger 2016) So is that people like to be familiar Warm Glow Heuristic, or to be novel Coolidge Effect? The answer is both: Goldilocks Effect or the middle ground. References "],["goldilocks-effect.html", "4.5 Goldilocks Effect", " 4.5 Goldilocks Effect just the right amount - U-shaped relationship. Beth Hess and Joan M.Waring introduced the term to refer to the optimal level of contact with kin that satisfies married couples. (Spanier and Lerner 1978) Relatively complex things may take longer to learn but also have a longer-lasting appeal. Affective reactions often follow a Goldilocks effect or interviewed U-shape trajectory. Too novel, and it is unfamiliar. Too familiar, and its boring; the middle is just right. (Berger 2016) Moderately discrepant thing s tend to garner more attention (McCall and McGhee 1977) One way to encourage perseverance is to shrink the comparison set, breaking larger groups into smaller ones based on performance Affection reactions operate under this mechanism. Too novel products make use feel unease (or neutral) because we are unfamiliar. But the things that we interact too many times bored us. However, the right amount of interaction will hold our affection reaction at the optimal level. Complexity also works on the same scale. Simple things can have us quickly attracted to, but we will get bored of it quickly. Complex things will take long time to learn. But once we get accustomed to it, its hard to get rid of a habit.
