If you do not manually label them, there will be automatic labels anyway, e.g., Chapter ??. Doing social science research requires researchers to know a lot of social theories and also apply them to the right context. This was an overwhelming task for me as a Ph.D. student since there was an enormous amount of theories out there and people seem to just know and talk about them like their second language. Professors told me that through time I will read up and acquire more and more theories (or at least the relevant ones). However, my systematic mind cannot tolerate a disorganized way of learning or acquiring knowledge piece-meal like this. Hence, I read up on some handbooks and cheat-sheet regarding social theories. And, I compile these theories for my future research. If you read my first book on data analysis [https://bookdown.org/mike/data_analysis/], you will know how forgetful I can be. So again, I have to write down another book in a systematic way that I can quickly skim back in the future for relevant theories for my research. And please keep in mind that, by no means, this guide is a comprehensive one. Hence, if you think I should change anything, feel free to click on edit to modify that section. Recommendations on how to consume this book: If you know what you are looking for and just want to quickly brush up on a theory. You can just go to that theory section title. If you want an overview of all relevant theories, you can follow this book from the beginning till the end (my goal is write the most succinct version of every theory as possible).

And resources are power, and one organizations need others to survive. Hence, power and resource dependence are interlocked. Since an organizations power (A) over another (B) is the same thing as organization Bs dependence on organization A. We can see that power is relational and situaitonal.

However, for the ultra rich class, the highest price does not command highest brand prominence, but actually lowest brand prominence. (a small set of ultra rich people know) The identity-signaling drives things to both catch on and die out Counterfeiting helps speed up the process We know that the mere exposure can increase our preference towards an object. Interestingly, the similarity between a new object and one that we are familiarity with also have the same effect. Novel but dont be too novel.

Compared to beginner coffee buyers, customers who almost complete a card buy more coffee (come back to the store sooner) (Kivetz, Urminsky, and Zheng 2006) Similar effects are also found in animals, rats are more motivated when they are closer to their goals (Brown 1948; Hull 1932, 1934) However, too far behind couples with direct competition could not only lead people a little behind more motivated, but people far behind more demotivated. (Fershtman and Gneezy 2011) Interestingly, the mechanism for favored candidate to lose motivation is different from underdogs.

(Lyubomirsky, Sheldon, and Schkade 2005) long-term happiness depends 50% on a persons genetic set point, 10% on circumstances (whether you, how rich, how healthy they are), and 40% on what they choose to think and do. Hence, even if our friends are happy, they happiness will wear off, and return us the original level.

Interestingly, females exhibit this effect to a lesser extent. The name Coolidge comes from a joke about President Calvin Coolidge. The story is as follow:  The President and Mrs. Coolidge were being shown [separately] around an experimental government farm. When [Mrs. Coolidge] came to the chicken yard she noticed that a rooster was mating very frequently. She asked the attendant how often that happened and was told,Dozens of times each day.\" Mrs. Coolidge said, Tell that to the President when he comes by. Upon being told, the President asked, Same hen every time? The reply was, Oh, no, Mr. President, a different hen every time. President: Tell that to Mrs. Coolidge. (Johnson 1972) References "],["social-facilitation-inhibition.html", "4.2 Social Facilitation / Inhibition", " 4.2 Social Facilitation / Inhibition This phenomenon happens when the mere presence of others can alter ones performance. When the presence of others improve ones performance, we term it social facilitation. When the presence of others impair ones performance, we term it social inhibition. The phenomenon was first documented by (Triplett 1898). And later (Allport 1920) labeled it as social facilitation The moderator that decides whether the process is social facilitation or social inhibition is task familiarity/ complexity. The more familiar one is with a task, social facilitation will occur. The more difficult or novel a task is, the more likely that social inhibition will occur. According to (Zajonc and Sales 1966), an audience impairs the acquisition of new responses and facilitates the emission of well-learned responses (dominant responses). Hence, when facing a difficult task in combination with the presence of others will result in high arousal which results in stress and poor performance. The mechanism can be specified by the Distraction Conflict Theory, which states that the conflict between giving attention to spectators and to a task affects performance. Better performers resolve this conflict and direct more attention to the task. Another mechanism claim that its not the presence of others that affects performance, but the knowledge of others evaluation affect performance. Performers are aroused by audiences because they know that the are being evaluated. Hence, technically, passive spectators are not that passive. (Cottrell et al. 1968). This attempt to appear better in others eyes is also known as impression management, which has been studied extensively in management.

(Leibenstein 1950) In the market of unique, expensive, or unusual products, price can be seen as quality itself. These items typically have high economic value (status) but low practical value. The availability of a product is negatively correlated with it snob value. Examples are arts, designer clothes. References "],["warm-glow-heuristic.html", "4.4 Warm Glow Heuristic", " 4.4 Warm Glow Heuristic The positive valence of a stimulus increases its perceived familiarity, even in the absence of prior exposure. (Monin 2003) Familiarity leads to liking because the ease of retrieving information in our brain. This mechanism also has evolutionary benefits, which helps familiarity stay together (spouses, children, parents). We know that familiarity leads to liking (preference), but the the other way around also works.

Beth Hess and Joan M.Waring introduced the term to refer to the optimal level of contact with kin that satisfies married couples. (Spanier and Lerner 1978) Affection reactions operate under this mechanism. Too novel products make use feel unease (or neutral) because we are unfamiliar. But the things that we interact too many times bored us. However, the right amount of interaction will hold our affection reaction at the optimal level. Complexity also works on the same scale. Simple things can have us quickly attracted to, but we will get bored of it quickly. Complex things will take long time to learn. But once we get accustomed to it, its hard to get rid of a habit.

The term was first coined by Michelle K. Ryan and Alexander Haslam, who studied FTSE 100. Later on, another study also found the effect in law students who were assigned more difficult cases. Possible explanations: Struggling companies can easily blame someone if she fails to pull the company out of trouble. Moreover, even if the company fails, they can still be labeled progressive. Note This effect also applies to minorities or any marginalized groups.
