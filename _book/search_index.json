If you do not manually label them, there will be automatic labels anyway, e.g., Chapter ??. Doing social science research requires researchers to know a lot of social theories and also apply them to the right context. This was an overwhelming task for me as a Ph.D. student since there was an enormous amount of theories out there and people seem to just know and talk about them like their second language. Professors told me that through time I will read up and acquire more and more theories (or at least the relevant ones). However, my systematic mind cannot tolerate a disorganized way of learning or acquiring knowledge piece-meal like this. Hence, I read up on some handbooks and cheat-sheet regarding social theories. And, I compile these theories for my future research. If you read my first book on data analysis [link], you will know how forgetful I can be. So again, I have to write down another book in a systematic way that I can quickly skim back in the future for relevant theories for my research. Recommendations on how to consume this book: If you know what you are looking for and just want to quickly brush up on a theory. You can just go to that theory section title. If you want an overview of all relevant theories, you can follow this book from the beginning till the end (my goal is write the most succint version of every theory as possible).

Interestingly, females exhibit this effect to a lesser extent. The name Coolidge comes from a joke about President Calvin Coolidge. The story is as follow:  The President and Mrs. Coolidge were being shown [separately] around an experimental government farm. When [Mrs. Coolidge] came to the chicken yard she noticed that a rooster was mating very frequently. She asked the attendant how often that happened and was told,Dozens of times each day.\" Mrs. Coolidge said, Tell that to the President when he comes by. Upon being told, the President asked, Same hen every time? The reply was, Oh, no, Mr. President, a different hen every time. President: Tell that to Mrs. Coolidge.
