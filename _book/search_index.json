If you do not manually label them, there will be automatic labels anyway, e.g., Chapter ??. Doing social science research requires researchers to know a lot of social theories and also apply them to the right context. This was an overwhelming task for me as a Ph.D. student since there was an enormous amount of theories out there and people seem to just know and talk about them like their second language. Professors told me that through time I will read up and acquire more and more theories (or at least the relevant ones). However, my systematic mind cannot tolerate a disorganized way of learning or acquiring knowledge piece-meal like this. Hence, I read up on some handbooks and cheat-sheet regarding social theories. And, I compile these theories for my future research. If you read my first book on data analysis [https://bookdown.org/mike/data_analysis/], you will know how forgetful I can be. So again, I have to write down another book in a systematic way that I can quickly skim back in the future for relevant theories for my research. And please keep in mind that, by no means, this guide is a comprehensive one. Hence, if you think I should change anything, feel free to click on edit to modify that section. Recommendations on how to consume this book: If you know what you are looking for and just want to quickly brush up on a theory. You can just go to that theory section title. If you want an overview of all relevant theories, you can follow this book from the beginning till the end (my goal is write the most succinct version of every theory as possible).

Interestingly, females exhibit this effect to a lesser extent. The name Coolidge comes from a joke about President Calvin Coolidge. The story is as follow:  The President and Mrs. Coolidge were being shown [separately] around an experimental government farm. When [Mrs. Coolidge] came to the chicken yard she noticed that a rooster was mating very frequently. She asked the attendant how often that happened and was told,Dozens of times each day.\" Mrs. Coolidge said, Tell that to the President when he comes by. Upon being told, the President asked, Same hen every time? The reply was, Oh, no, Mr. President, a different hen every time. President: Tell that to Mrs. Coolidge. (Johnson 1972) References "],["social-facilitation-inhibition.html", "4.2 Social Facilitation / Inhibition", " 4.2 Social Facilitation / Inhibition This phenomenon happens when the mere presence of others can alter ones performance. When the presence of others improve ones performance, we term it social facilitation. When the presence of others impair ones performance, we term it social inhibition. The phenomenon was first documented by (Triplett 1898). And later (Allport 1920) labeled it as social facilitation The moderator that decides whether the process is social facilitation or social inhibition is task familiarity/ complexity. The more familiar one is with a task, social facilitation will occur. The more difficult or novel a task is, the more likely that social inhibition will occur. According to (Zajonc and Sales 1966), an audience impairs the acquisition of new responses and facilitates the emission of well-learned responses (dominant responses). Hence, when facing a difficult task in combination with the presence of others will result in high arousal which results in stress and poor performance. The mechanism can be specified by the Distraction Conflict Theory, which states that the conflict between giving attention to spectators and to a task affects performance. Better performers resolve this conflict and direct more attention to the task. Another mechanism claim that its not the presence of others that affects performance, but the knowledge of others evaluation affect performance. Performers are aroused by audiences because they know that the are being evaluated. Hence, technically, passive spectators are not that passive. (Cottrell et al. 1968) There are two stream of research which are Audience Effect Coaction Effect 4.2.1 Audience Effect Passive spectators affects performance Notable articles are: increased multiplication performance (Travis 1925) decreased memorizing a list of nonsense words (Pessin 1933) 4.2.2 Coaction Effect Active participants (same activity separately)affect performance The effect was also documented in animals such as ants will dig three times more with the presence of other ants (Chen 1937) animals will eat more with the presence of other of their species (Platt, Yaksh, and Darby 1967) References "],["phenomenon.html", "Chapter 5 Phenomenon", " Chapter 5 Phenomenon "],["final-words.html", "Chapter 6 Final Words", " Chapter 6 Final Words We have finished a nice book.
