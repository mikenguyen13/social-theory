# Effect

This chapter is dedicated to well-known effects that explain interesting phenomenon. 

## Coolidge Effect
This effect comes from the biological world, where male mammals renew their sexual interest when a new female is introduced even though the males have shown exhaustion from encounters with the previous partners. Interestingly, females exhibit this effect to a lesser extent.  

The name Coolidge comes from a joke about President Calvin Coolidge. The story is as follow:  
"... The President and Mrs. Coolidge were being shown [separately] around an experimental government farm. When [Mrs. Coolidge] came to the chicken yard she noticed that a rooster was mating very frequently. She asked the attendant how often that happened and was told, "Dozens of times each day." Mrs. Coolidge said, "Tell that to the President when he comes by." Upon being told, the President asked, "Same hen every time?" The reply was, "Oh, no, Mr. President, a different hen every time." President: "Tell that to Mrs. Coolidge." [@Johnson_1972]
